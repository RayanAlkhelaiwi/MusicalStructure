    <string name="other_class_description">A MediaPlayer is a class used to allow the app to have the support for the media files, and the ability to play them,
        also an AudioManager can be used to better manage the audio files. Additionally, to better design the app to minimize the use of many activities, is to
        have fragments in one activity. In this app, we can combine songs list and artists list, as two fragments, in one activity with two tabs at the top to navigate
        between them.</string>
